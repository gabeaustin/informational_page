				It has been a pleasure teaching all of you! Hopefully this pandemic gets better by next trimester. I wanted to pass along some resources if you are interested in learning more about Computer Science and Web Development. Here are a few platforms that you can inform your parents about if you are interested. THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. I am only providing resources for you if you are interested in furthering your Web Development knowledge.

				I know you will have a great trimester 2. Keep up all your hard work!!
